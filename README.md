Comp 20 - Fall 2016

The purpose of this GitHub respository is to contain and display several
assignments I worked on in Comp 20 - Web Programming.


My favorite assignment that I worked on was the 2048 server-side assignment.
Before this, I had never worked with databases before and I enjoyed learning
more about how all of the different platforms and technologies connect.


I think I have grown a lot since day 1 of this course. Previously, I had very
basic understanding of HTML/CSS/Javascript and had no comcept about how servers
or the internet really worked. It was amazing to learn more about the web, the
internet, and the tools used to build web applications.


The most important thing I learned this semester is that there is much more to
being a "software engineer" than just writing a program that works. There
are many other aspects to keep in mind like scalability and security. The
security assignment showed me how much I am oblivious to security measures in
my work and how important tand overlooked they are. In my group project I thought
a lot about the functionality of having a multiplayer game and how we could have many of
these occuring at the same time. I really enjoyed the problem solving that went into
this and spending a lot of time thinking about the architecture of the system
before writing any code.


After spending my group project focusing on server side code and MongoDB, I 
would love to explore using other databases like SQL style databases and Firebase.
